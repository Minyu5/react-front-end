# Important Notes
1. CORS (access-control-allow-origin) <br />
If using chrome, please install https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en if necessary

2. responsive design <br />
I was going to use breakpoints but semantics ui offers a “stackable grid” shortcut so I chose to use that one instead. The folder for responsive designs are there just for reference.
